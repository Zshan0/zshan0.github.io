                <h1 id="intuition-on-pspace-class">Intuition on PSPACE class</h1>
<p>Languages decidable in finite time by a Deterministic Turing Machine with polynomial space 
all belong to the <span class="arithmatex">\(\text{PSPACE}\)</span> class. In this blog, we will describe 
the polynomial heirarchy in terms of Oracle access and show how it is equal 
to the PSPACE class. Rather than a textbook approach I would like to talk about 
it more intuitively and less formally.</p>
<p>You can represent the size of the configuration of the TM in <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathcal{O}(S(n))\)</span>
bits. If there is a path from the starting configuration to the accept 
configuration then the machine halts at accept.</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
    C_{acc} - C_{start} \iff x \in L
\]</div>
<h2 id="grasping-pspace">Grasping PSPACE</h2>
<p>There is not much to understand about the complexity class PSPACE on it's, unless 
it is compared to other classes. For example, PSPACE is certainly bigger than 
the class NP, because it can re-use the space to check all the non-deterministic 
paths of polynomial time. The same statement can be made about the relation 
between co-NP and PSPACE.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-ladder-npnpnpdots">Creating a Ladder <span class="arithmatex">\(NP^{{NP^{NP}}^{\dots}}\)</span></h2>
<p>It is simple enough to compare NP, co-NP. One can go a few more steps ahead to 
make a ladder of NP oracles. <span class="arithmatex">\(NP^{NP}\)</span> is a machine that can definitely solve 
problems from both NP and co-NP. The machine <span class="arithmatex">\(NP^{NP}\)</span> has two-layer 
non-determinism. It can query for a non-deterministic solution, as well as use
that solution in all of it's non-deterministic paths. Trivially it can solve 
NP problems by not choosing to use the oracle at all. Moreover it can solve
co-NP as it can query the oracle for the solution, and flip the answer when 
necessary.</p>
<p>Comparing the power of <span class="arithmatex">\(NP^{NP}\)</span> to PSPACE, it is not difficult to see that
PSPACE can simulate both the oracle as well as the non-deterministic machine 
in polynomial space each. Giving us <span class="arithmatex">\(NP^{NP} \subset PSPACE\)</span>. Regardless of 
how many ever polynomial-many oracles you stack up, they will remain within 
the simulation capability of the PSPACE class.</p>
<h2 id="polynomial-heirarchy">Polynomial Heirarchy</h2>
<p>In the above section we described the ladder of NP oracles, this ladder is 
infact equivalent to another well-known set of classes called as the polynomial 
heirarchy. Polynomial heirarchy contains <span class="arithmatex">\(\sum_k^p\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(\prod_k^p\)</span>. They defer 
by whether their base machine is an NP machine, or a co-NP machine. To 
represent the polynomial heirarchy in terms of a deterministic Turing Machine, 
we use the witness notation of NP and co-NP.</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
    L \in \text{NP} \iff \bigg( x \in L \iff \exists v M(x, v) = 1 \bigg)
\]</div>
<p>Similarly, we define co-NP.</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
    L \in \text{co-NP} \iff \bigg( x \in L \iff \forall v M(x, v) = 1 \bigg)
\]</div>
<h3 id="alternating-quantifiers">Alternating Quantifiers</h3>
<p>To build one layer on top of NP, we can not just have two different existential 
quantifiers. Because these two sequential existential quantifiers can be 
absorbed into one <span class="arithmatex">\(\exists v_1, \exists v_2 = \exists v_3\)</span> where 
<span class="arithmatex">\(v_3 = v_1\cdot v_2\)</span>. Instead we need to <em>alternate</em> the quantifier from <span class="arithmatex">\(\exists\)</span> 
to <span class="arithmatex">\(\forall\)</span>. We define <span class="arithmatex">\(\sum_2^p\)</span> as follows:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
     x \in L \iff \exists v_1 \forall v_2 M(x, v_1, v_2) = 1
\]</div>
<p>We show that <span class="arithmatex">\(NP^{NP} = \sum_2^p\)</span>. First we show 
<span class="arithmatex">\(NP^{NP} \subset \sum_2^p\)</span>. The first existential quantifier takes care of the 
non-deterministic nature of NP machine. We then use the <span class="arithmatex">\(\forall\)</span> quantifier 
wherever the machine invokes the NP oracle. We flip the output incase the result
deems to, accessing non-determinism in an oracular fashion allows the output flipping.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Show that <span class="arithmatex">\(\sum_2^p \subset NP^{NP}\)</span></p>
<p>Once you solve the exercise, the equality is established.</p>
<hr />
<p>We define Truly Quantified Boolean Formula (<strong>TQBF</strong>) as the class union of 
any number of alternating quantifiers applied on a polynomial deterministic 
Turing Machine.</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
    \text{TQBF} = \cup_{k=1} \sum_k^p
\]</div>
<h2 id="tqbf-is-pspace-complete">TQBF is PSPACE-complete</h2>
<p>The above section showed that the polynomial heirarchy can be represented by 
layering of NP oracles. This heirarchy itself lies withing PSPACE. You can 
convert this entire heirarchy to a single problem, which is TQBF. What we would 
like to show next is the equivalence between PSPACE and polynomial heirarchy.</p>
<p>We refer back to the configuration space size as well as the condition for 
a string belonging to the language described earlier. Now we set a bound on the 
path length. Without loss of generality, we can claim that there are $2^{\mathcal{O}(S(n))} 
nodes in the configuration space. The longest chain from <span class="arithmatex">\(C_{start}\)</span> to <span class="arithmatex">\(C_{accept}\)</span>. </p>
