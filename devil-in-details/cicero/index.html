<p>Reading the biography of Marcus Tulius Cicero by Anthony Everitt felt like well written fiction full of content, suspense and appreciation towards the protagonist. Although it is unfair to the people of his time to consider him as the protagonist, his story puts him on the pedastal of no less than a hero for the Roman Republic, a failed one nonetheless due to circumstances. The story of Marcus Cicero came to a very depressing but a brave end, the last two years of his life after the death of Julius Ceasar makes him less of an untouchable character and more relatable due to his mistakes.</p>
<p>The unstable and chaotic period of Cicero has given birth to many narratives and popular historical figures, and amongst them his narrative has managed to survive. This is partially luck, and majorly it is due to the influence he has had over the direction Roman republic steered. In a parallel universe, he would have joined the First Truimvirate and his narrative would have been twisted to match that of Caesar. Peering into his personal life via his letters, it made his character a vulnerable, insecure and a fame seeker who would still not give up on the fundamental believes of constitution and his duty towards the state.</p>
<p>The fall of Roman Republic was best seen through a man who had previously saved and almost succeeded for the last time in his life. The perspectives helped me understand that unstable flow of the Republic in the last century of BCE, and how so many crucial moments could have shaped the history of Rome and by an extension the history of humanity. It is reductive to say that the series of events were inevitable, the turmoil could have lasted till the fall of Roman Republic completely, it could have skipped the Empire era.</p>
<p>Looking back into the era, the most memorable moment for me remains his trail against Catalina, it was at the height of the political tension which in history could have been a complete hoax to protect Cicero's action. I personally view this as a artifact of historical manipulation and fragility that could sway the facts in favour of the writer. Marcus Tuluis Cicero extended his influence for the public good during his Consul, and this influence reached the same height after the death of Caesar when he applied his divide-and-conquer-lock-hands strategy to prevent the collusion of Antony and Octavious, and that makes him a legend of the last moments of the Roman Republic.</p>
