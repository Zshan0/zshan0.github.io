Do Protein folding and sudoku have something in common? it might not seem so but Complexity Theory tells us that if we had an algorithm that could solve sudoku efficiently then we could adapt it to predict for protein folding. This same property is held by classic nintendo games such as super mario bros. 
We will demonstrate one such example where we prove how "Celeste" also shares such property by proving it to be NP-complete. And then later show how a small change in it makes the game much harder(Presumably) to compute; to be precise, PSPACE-complete.
